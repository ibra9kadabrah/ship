# Updated Docker Deployment Plan for Render

**Context:** This plan follows the successful local `npm install` using Node.js 18.x, which generated a compatible `package-lock.json`.

**Remaining Steps:**

1.  **Commit All Necessary Changes:**
    *   The next step is to commit all the recent changes to your Git repository. This ensures that Render will pull the correct versions of your files. The files to be committed include:
        *   [`package.json`](package.json) (with updated dependencies like `better-sqlite3` and `bcryptjs`)
        *   [`package-lock.json`](package-lock.json) (the newly generated one from the successful `npm install` with Node.js 18.x)
        *   [`src/models/user.model.ts`](src/models/user.model.ts) (updated to import `bcryptjs`)
        *   [`src/db/connection.ts`](src/db/connection.ts) (updated to use `process.env.DATABASE_PATH`)
        *   [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) (if not already committed)
        *   [`.dockerignore`](.dockerignore) (if not already committed)
        *   [`entrypoint.sh`](entrypoint.sh) (if not already committed)

2.  **Configure Render Service:**
    *   Once the changes are committed and pushed, you'll need to configure your service on Render. Based on [`DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md#Phase-3-Render-Configuration`](DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md:134), the key settings are:
        *   **Service Type:** Docker
        *   **Root Directory:** (Usually blank, meaning the root of your repository)
        *   **Dockerfile Path:** `./Dockerfile`
        *   **Persistent Disk:**
            *   **Mount Path:** `/usr/src/app/data` (This is where your SQLite database will be stored persistently)
        *   **Environment Variables:**
            *   `PORT=3000`
            *   `DATABASE_PATH=/usr/src/app/data/database.sqlite` (Matches the persistent disk mount path)
            *   `NODE_ENV=production`
            *   `JWT_SECRET`: You will need to set this to a strong, unique secret value directly in the Render dashboard.
            *   Add any other environment variables your application requires (e.g., API keys, other service URLs).

3.  **Deploy and Test:**
    *   Push your committed changes to the GitHub (or other Git provider) repository branch that Render is configured to watch.
    *   Render should automatically trigger a new deployment. If not, you can trigger it manually.
    *   Monitor the deployment logs in the Render dashboard for any errors.
    *   Once the deployment is successful, thoroughly test your application to ensure it's working as expected.
